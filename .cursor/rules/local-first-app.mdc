## Local First

This is a local first app.
You will only use LegendState with Supabase plugin for state management.
Since this is a local first app, all components should be client components with "use client" directive.

## Style

Prefer to use Shadcn UI components where possible. Install the components if not already installed.
Prefer to use Lucide icons where possible.

## App Structure

The app is built with App Router.
The components are in the src/components folder.
The app is in the src/app folder.
The lib is in the src/lib folder.
The styles are in the src/styles folder.

When creating components don't use default export, use named export.

## TypeScript Usage

Prefer to use type instead of inteface for all types.
Prefer inference instead of explicit type declaration.

## ESLint Usage

Make sure to follow linting rules in [.eslintrc.cjs](mdc:.eslintrc.cjs) when writing code to avoid linter errors
